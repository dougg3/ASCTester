# ASCTester

This is a test program for the Apple Sound Chip (ASC) and various variants used on classic Mac models from the '80s and '90s.

It is still a work in progress. The goal is to create some sanity tests so you can compare emulators and damaged machines against known-good behavior on good hardware.
